## Testing
Unit tests have been created using the pytest package and can be ran automatically using
the command `pytest` in the main repository folder. Pytest will search for any files named
`test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and run all tests within them, see
[pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for more information.
