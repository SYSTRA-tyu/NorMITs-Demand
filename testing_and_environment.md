## Python Environment

The Python version and package requirements are given in "Pipfile" and "Pipfile.lock",
these files are created and maintained automatically by [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).
To install the packages required to run the External Forecast System first install Python 3.8 and 
run the following command to install pipenv.

`pip install pipenv`

Once pipenv has been installed successfully then run the `pipenv install` (from within
the NorMITs-Demand folder), which will read "Pipfile.lock" and install all the packages required.

Once the above command has ran you can activate the environment by running `pipenv shell` then
you can run any Python files with the usual `python` command. To add any new Python
packages to the environment use `pipenv install package_name` instead of pip, this will download
and install the package and update "Pipfile" and "Pipfile.lock" with the version information.

## Testing
Unit tests have been created using the pytest package and can be ran automatically using
the command `pytest` in the main repository folder. Pytest will search for any files named
`test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and run all tests within them, see
[pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for more information.
