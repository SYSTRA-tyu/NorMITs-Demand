        ----------
        employment_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: land_use_employment_data} pairs.
            Should have the columns as defined in:
            HBAttractionModel._target_cols['employment']

        production_balance_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: path_to_production_to_control_to} pairs.
            These paths should be gotten from nd.HBProduction model.
            Must contain the same keys as land_use_paths, but it can contain
            more (any extras will be ignored).
            These productions will be used to control the produced attractions.

        trip_weights_path:
            The path to the attraction trip weights.
            Should have the columns as defined in:
            HBAttractionModel._target_cols['trip_weight']

        mode_splits_path:
            The path to attraction mode split.
            Should have the columns as defined in:
            HBAttractionModel._target_cols['mode_split']

        export_home:
            Path to export attraction outputs.

        balance_zoning:
            The zoning system to balance the attractions to the productions at.
            A translation must exist between this and the running zoning
            system, which is MSOA by default. If left as None, then no spatial
            balance is done, only a segmental balance.

        constraint_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: constraint_path} pairs.
            Must contain the same keys as land_use_paths, but it can contain
            more (any extras will be ignored).
            If set - will be used to constrain the attractions - a report will
            be written before and after.

        process_count:
            The number of processes to create in the Pool. Typically this
            should not exceed the number of cores available.
            Defaults to consts.PROCESS_COUNT.

        hb_attraction_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: notem_segmented_HB_attractions_data} pairs.
            These paths should come from nd.HBAttraction model and should

        nhb_production_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: notem_segmented_NHB_productions_data} pairs.

            These productions will be used to control the produced attractions.

        export_home:
            Path to export NHB attraction outputs.

        balance_zoning:
            The zoning system to balance the attractions to the productions at.
            A translation must exist between this and the running zoning
            system, which is MSOA by default. If left as None, then no spatial
            balance is done, only a segmental balance.

        constraint_paths:
            Dictionary of {year: constraint_path} pairs.
            Must contain the same keys as land_use_paths, but it can contain
            more (any extras will be ignored).
            If set - will be used to constrain the attractions - a report will
            be written before and after.

            The number of processes to create in the Pool. Typically this
